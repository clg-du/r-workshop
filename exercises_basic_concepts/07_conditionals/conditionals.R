# Exercises: Conditionals
#
# Exercise 1 ----
#
# Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd.
#
# Hint: Use the modulo operator to check if the number is divisible by 2.
#
# Your code here:


# Exercise 2 ----
#
# Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
#
# Hint: Use nested if-else statements to check the sign of the number.
#
# Your code here:


# Exercise 3 ----
#
# Write a program that checks if a given string is empty or not.
#
# Hint: Use the nchar() function to check the length of the string.
#
# Your code here:


# Exercise 4 ----
#
# Write a program that checks if a given vector contains a specified element.
#
# Hint: Use the %in% operator to check if the element is in the vector.
#
# Your code here:


# Exercise 5 ----
#
# Write a program that checks if a given number is between two other numbers.
#
# Hint: Use the logical AND operator (&) to combine the conditions.
#
# Your code here:


# Exercise 6 ----
#
# Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.
#
# Explanation: Check the following conditions for a leap year:
# 1. The year is divisible by 4.
# 2. The year is not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
#
# Example: 2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 and 400, but not by
#          100. 1900 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 4 and 100,
#          but not by 400.
#
# Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) to check divisibility.
#
# Your code here:


# Exercise 7 ----
#
# Write a program that checks if a given number is a prime number.
#
# Explanation: A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible
# by 1 and itself.
#
# Example: 7 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 7.
#
# Hint: After checking whether the number is greater than one, use a loop to
#      check divisibility by all numbers from 2 to n-1. If the number is
#      divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.
#

# Exercise 8 ----
#
# Write a program that checks the grades of students based on their scores.
#
# Explanation: The program should assign grades based on the following criteria:
# - A: 90-100
# - B: 80-89
# - C: 70-79
# - D: 60-69
# - F: 0-59
#
# Hint: Use nested if-else statements to assign grades based on score ranges.
#
# Your code here:

# Exercise 9 ----
#
# Write a program that checks if a given number is a perfect square.
#
# Explanation: A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product
# of an integer with itself.
#
# Example: 9 is a perfect square because it can be expressed as 3 * 3.
#
# Hint: Use the sqrt() function to check if the square root of the number is an
# integer.
#
# Your code here:

# Exercise 10 ----
#
# Write a program that checks if a given number is a palindrome.
#
# Explanation: A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and
# backwards.
#
# Example: 121 is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.
#
# Hint: Convert the number to a string and compare it with its reverse. Use the
#       rev() function to reverse the characters in a string. Use the
#       as.character() function to convert a number to a string. Use the
#       strsplit() function to split a string into individual characters.
