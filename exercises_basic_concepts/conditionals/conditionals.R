# Please note that in this exercise we will use the %% operator, which is the
# modulo operator, or "mod" operator. The modulo operator returns the 
# remainder of a division.

# Example: 5 %% 2 = 1, because 5 / 2 = 2 with remainder 1.
#          i.e., 5 = 2 * 2 + 1.

# The modulo operator is, in particular, useful for checking if a number is even or odd!
# Other use cases exist, such as in cryptography, but we will not cover them here.

# Exercise 1: Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd.


# Exercise 2: Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.


# Exercise 3: Write a program that checks if a given string is empty or not.


# Exercise 4: Write a program that checks if a given vector contains a specified element.


# Exercise 5: Write a program that checks if a given number is between two other numbers.


# Exercise 6: Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.


# Exercise 7: Write a program that checks if a given number is a prime number.
