#' Please note that in this exercise we will use the %% operator, which is the
#' modulo operator, or "mod" operator. The modulo operator returns the 
#' remainder of a division.

#' Example: 5 %% 2 = 1, because 5 / 2 = 2 with remainder 1.
#'          i.e., 5 = 2 * 2 + 1.

#' The modulo operator is, in particular, useful for checking if a number is even or odd!
#' Other use cases exist, such as in cryptography, but we will not cover them here.

#' Exercise 1 ----
#
#' Write a function that will return the sum of 2 integers.
#' 


#' Exercise 2: Write a function what will return TRUE if a given integer is inside a vector.


#' Exercise 3: Write a function that given a data frame will print by screen 
#'             the name of the column and the class of data it contains 
#'             (e.g. Variable1 is Numeric).


#' Exercise 4: Create a function that given a vector and an integer will return 
#'             how many times the integer appears inside the vector.


#' Exercise 5: Create a function that given a vector will print by screen 
#'             the mean and the standard deviation, it will optionally also 
#'             print the median if the vector has an odd number of elements.


#' Exercise 7: Create a function that given an integer will calculate how many 
#'             divisors it has (other than 1 and itself). 
#'             Make the divisors appear by screen.


#' Exercise 8: Create a function that given a data frame, and a number or 
#'             character will return the data frame with the character or number changed to NA.
