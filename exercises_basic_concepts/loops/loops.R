# To see all arithmetic operators, type ?Arithmetic in the console.

# Please note that in this exercise we will use the %% operator, which is the
# modulo operator, or "mod" operator. The modulo operator returns the 
# remainder of a division.

# Example: 5 %% 2 = 1, because 5 / 2 = 2 with remainder 1.
#          i.e., 5 = 2 * 2 + 1.

# The modulo operator is, in particular, useful for checking if a number is even or odd!
# Other use cases exist, such as in cryptography, but we will not cover them here.

# Exercise 1: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
#
# Hint:       Remember that you do not need to write all numbers from 1 to 10 manually.


# Exercise 2: Write a program that prints the even numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.


# Exercise 3: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given 
#             number using a `for` loop.
#
# Hint:       The factorial is defined as the product of all positive integers 
#             less than or equal to the number.


# Exercise 4: Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up 
#             to a given number using a `for` loop.
#             If you find this exercise too difficult, you can skip it.
#
# Warning:    The Fibonacci sequence grows very quickly, so be careful with your choice of number!
#             Also, the Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative numbers.
#
# Hint:       The Fibonacci sequence is defined as the sum of the two previous
#             numbers in the sequence, starting with 0 and 1. 


# Exercise 5: Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a 
#             given number using a `for` loop.
# 
# Hint:       The multiplication table of a number is the product of that number
#             with all the numbers from 1 to 10.
#             Also, the result should be printed in a human-readable format,
#             i.e., "5 x 1 = 5", "5 x 2 = 10", etc.


# Exercise 6: Write a program that prints the prime numbers up to a given 
#             number using a `for` loop.
#
# Hint 1:     A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself.
#             Although this script is related to loops, conditional statements
#             are also needed to solve this exercise.
# Hint 2:     Think how the modulo operator can be used to check if a number is prime.
# 
# Hint 3:     To stop a loop, you can use the `break` statement.
#             To be explicit, just include `break` inside of an `if` statement (or loop)


# Exercise 7: Write a program that prints the sum of the digits of a 
#             given number using a `for` loop.
#
# Hint 1:     You can convert a number to a string using the `as.character()` function,
#             and then split the string into a vector of characters using the `strsplit()` function.
